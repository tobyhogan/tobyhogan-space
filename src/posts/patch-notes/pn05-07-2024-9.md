title: Habitazen v1.1 Patch Notes
---

This is the first patch notes entry I've made on tobyhogan.space, so I'll just do my best to update with everything I've build so far:

☑ Auth, accounts, sign in(with google), sign out
☑ Navigation, page routes, secure/restricted routes
☑ Database, data storage, update and add records
☑ Main habit tracker table, week view add new habits, delete, archive
☑ Popout sidebar with addtional options
☑ Dark mode, themes, mobile responsiveness


What I'm working on and want to have in the next(or a near future) iteration:

☐ Ability to see all habit history through a calendar view
☐ Improved table using react-table potentially?
☐ Better mobile responsiveness for sidebar, so it takes up entire screen
☑ Week view highlights current day's habits
☐ Total habit completions and current steak visible from week view


Yeah so that's not exactly a short order, and I'll definitely have my hands full to say the least, but many of these features would be reaally nice to have, so it'll be worth it for sure :D

Very cool to see everything I've done so far summarised in one place as well...

TH out.

Decided that I'm going to update the goals on this page by marking them as ticked when I do them
