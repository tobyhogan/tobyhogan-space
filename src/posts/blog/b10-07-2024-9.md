title: Mid-July Project Updates
---

Hey, okay, it's been a few days since I made my last blog post(the 5th of July), so this is sort of an update of what I'm working on right now I suppose. It feels good to have this blog though, I definitely don't regret making it, and it was fun to make(when it started to work at least ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜…), and I'm still partially working on it, tweaking it and stuff to optimise it.

I've also been working on a "metrics tracker", which is sort of a useful development tool that does/will allow me to see core analytics and statistics about the project that I want. The database system I'm using has a feature similar to this, but it's obviously extremely technical and has so much data and information crammed onto the page(as it should be ofc), that it's kind of distracting and is obviously hardly usable on mobile so I can't use it on my phone or anything.

I'd argue that metrics and analytics are one of the funest parts of the project, as it's sort of a way of distilling(in the cloest way you can) all the complex abstract information and actions around it, into single numbers which is quite a satisfying process. So yeah, I've got it semi-working the way it is, I just need to set up some more triggers and database routines to make sure everything goes smoothly and it's all interconnected properly, so will sustain itself when I stop working on it, so that's going ok.

As for the core projet I'm working on at the moment: the habit tracker, that's going good as well, I'm still just figuring out how to get the new table system that I want
