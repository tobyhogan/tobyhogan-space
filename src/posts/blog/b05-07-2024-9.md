Okay!, so this is my third post, and I'm still thinking about what the next move for me to make is; whether I should try and get more user feedback or keep working on features of the habit tracker. What feautres? I want to have it so it highlights the current day, so you know that that can be your focus, that'd definitely be a good feature.

Yeah so I think I've decided that I *do* want to add some more features in this current development cycle, before starting the next promotion-engagment cycle. It's just like a useful features I can deefinitely see users wanting.

So I think I'll start working on the current day highlight feature, I'll see if I can add a screnshot of it once it's completed :D.
