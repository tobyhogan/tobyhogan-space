title: We Have a Blog :)
---


Ok!, so after I made the first post, I *did* decide that a blog would be a useful thing to have in my development journey, it did take a little bit of time to setup, a few hours essentially, wasn't especially difficult or time-consuming with the stack for this site that I'm using, including gatsby and some other bits and bobs...

As I'm writing this now the blog isn't technically "up" yet, it only works on my local machine so that will be the next step. What I was talking about in the previous post about the stage that I'm at now where I want to find users, but am not ready to advertise yet. So the product is like *semi*-usable, you could use it if you didn't mind some features not completely working and not everything being completely polished etc, but that isn't most users imo sooooo...

Yeah I think places like Indihackers, reddit and discord would be good. I'll probably start with indiehackers as it's typically less spammy than reddit and discord and has a better vibe in my opinion. As I said before also, I did make a post a few weeks ago but it didn't get to much traction üò≠ unfortunately, and I'm still trying to work out *why* that is, as I've made ones before that have gotten a nice number of comments, maybe it's just too generic and blended in, and let's be honest the idea of a habit tracker isn't exactly inspired genius in terms of a product idea it's sort of similar to To-Do lists which are literally the default practice project üòÖ.

But hold up, let me explain for a second there are obviously some reasons that I'm actually doing it - for some context, I'm definitely a "power" user of habit tracker websites, and have tried pretty much every one under the sun: habitify, habitica, everyday, habitory, dailyhabits, notion, text files, pen and paper so yea, and all of them work and well, but there are just some more advanced features that I've really been craving for in a single habit tracker. Some of them have one or two of these "advanced" features, but I haven't found one that bundles all of them.

Since I only finished school in the past year as well, its quite a nice project to start with for various reasons and to let me get a really good grip on the tech that I'm using to make it. Even if I'm the only person who uses this, IMO it would still be worth it :D.

So yess, I'll aim to do one of those things I talked about, try and find someone or a group of people who might be interested in pair ~~programming~~ testing, like it would be good to have some sort of extended relationship with this person/people and not just someone looking at the page for a few 10s of seconds. So these people would probably be other developers, I just need to *find* them, it may take a little bit of time, but in the past when I was more interested in working with other people than solo, I found plenty of cool people without a hitch so god be willing that will be my experience with this next task as well.

What I'll probably do is make an update post after I've been doing the search for a bit, and re-assess how it's going and what any next actions could be et cetera, I could also link my attempts in this post, to make it clearer what I'm thinking and doing. Looking forward to the update :) Also it is indepdence day in the US and was polling day here in UK, my first time ever posting a ballot which is cool, made me feel like a proper citizen of this country üòè
