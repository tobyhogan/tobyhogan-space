So I suppose that could be a next move?</p>\n<p>I would like to get this blog up though, even from writing now it seems like a useful idea. I’ve sort of had blogs in the past, made some posts here and there, nothing super consistent though but I’ve always liked the idea.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"04 Jul 2024","slug":"d04-07-2024-9","title":"Pre-Blog Thoughts"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"aa7c1a18-e584-5111-81e5-7e35e4c916d8","frontmatter__slug":"d04-07-2024-9","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"d04-07-2024-9"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
