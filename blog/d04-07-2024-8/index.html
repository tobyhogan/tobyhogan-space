<p>As I'm writing this now the blog isn't technically "up" yet, it only works on my local machine so that will be the next step. What I was talking about in the previous post about the stage that I'm at now where I want to find users, but am not ready to advertise yet. So the product is like <em>semi</em>-usable, you could use it if you didn't mind some features not completely working and not everything being completely polished etc, but that isn't most users imo sooooo...</p>
<p>Yeah I think places like Indihackers, reddit and discord would be good. I'll probably start with indiehackers as it's typically less spammy than reddit and discord and has a better vibe in my opinion. As I said before also, I did make a post a few weeks ago but it didn't get to much traction üò≠ unfortunately, and I'm still trying to work out <em>why</em> that is, as I've made ones before that have gotten a nice number of comments, maybe it's just too generic and blended in, and let's be honest the idea of a habit tracker isn't exactly inspired genius in terms of a product idea it's sort of similar to To-Do lists which are literally the default practice project üòÖ.</p>
<p>But hold up, let me explain for a second there are obviously some reasons that I'm actually doing it - for some context, I'm definitely a "power" user of habit tracker websites, and have tried pretty much every one under the sun: habitify, habitica, everyday, habitory, dailyhabits, notion, text files, pen and paper so yea, and all of them work and well, but there are just some more advanced features that I've really been craving for in a single habit tracker. Some of them have one or two of these "advanced" features, but I haven't found one that bundles all of them.</p>
<p>Since I only finished school in the past year as well, its quite a nice project to start with for various reasons and to let me get a really good grip on the tech that I'm using to make it. Even if I'm the only person who uses this, IMO it would still be worth it :D.</p>
<p>So yess, I'll aim to do one of those things I talked about, try and find someone or a group of people who might be interested in pair <del>programming</del> testing, like it would be good to have some sort of extended relationship with this person/people and not just someone looking at the page for a few 10s of seconds. So these people would probably be other developers, I just need to <em>find</em> them, it may take a little bit of time, but in the past when I was more interested in working with other people than solo, I found plenty of cool people without a hitch so god be willing that will be my experience with this next task as well.</p>
<p>What I'll probably do is make an update post after I've been doing the search for a bit, and re-assess how it's going and what any next actions could be et cetera, I could also link my attempts in this post, to make it clearer what I'm thinking and doing. Looking forward to the update :) Also it is indepdence day in the US and was polling day here in UK, my first time ever posting a ballot which is cool, made me feel like a proper citizen of this country üòè</p></div><div class=""><p class="text-center my-12 font-bold">¬© tobyhogan.space 2024</p></div></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/blog/d04-07-2024-8/";/*]]>*/</script><!-- slice-start id="_gatsby-scripts-1" -->
